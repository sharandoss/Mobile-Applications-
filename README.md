Exploring Swift UI has been an interesting expereince so far. So far, I have been exploring to understand the navagtion bar and navigation pages to better understand how to move from one page to an other within the App. During Spring Break, I intend to dive deep into adding complex layers to navation pages as suggested in Week 6 lecutre class. Up untill now, I've been trying to understand how strings,loops, and boolean expression expressions work in the context of Swift UI. In coming weeks I would like to explore camera filters as taught in class one and class six. Also, I would like to implement AR technology into my app eventually to better understand how Reality Kit works.
